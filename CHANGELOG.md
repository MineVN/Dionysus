## [0.1.15] - 2022-06-18

### Changes
* Improve merge checks
* Fix book meta speed for enchantments
* Fix build
* Add option to disable chunk loading past the world border
* Disable JNDI lookups in the default log config
* Improve performance of book meta pages

By only converting the pages when we need them, we save a lot of computing power for 99% of cases where pages are not needed and people just access the methods of ItemMeta.

* Improve performance of patch in more cases
* Fix small typos
* Fix error
